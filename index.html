  <p id="para">
    The final week of the College Football season is known as Rivalry week, where records are thrown out and teams play for tradition, pride and bragging rights. Yet 
    for as much as we think the 4 team Playoff field is set, the Week 12 rankings provided by the College Football Playoff Committee raises eyebrows for what feels like the 100th time. 5 teams with 4 losses are ranked, an all time high. UCF is ranked higher than Ohio State. And LSU, despite 2 losses (including a 29-0 blowout), is ranked above all of them at #7. Perhaps there is merit to each of these decisions, however without explanation or transparency, this system is imperfect to many. In order to understand how to fix this system, we must look at the history of college football's ranking system and how we reached the College Football Playoff.
  </p>

  <h3 id="h3-title">A Short Rankings History</h3></br>
  <h3 id="h4-title">1936 - 1997: The Poll Era</h3>
  <p id="para"><br>
    College Football (CFB) champions were crowned by different polls comprised of voters who met a predetermined criteria. The two most referenced polls were the AP Poll, which was voted upon by members of the media, and the USA Today Coaches Poll, which is voted upon by 62 selected CFB coaches. During this era, these polls would occasionally conflict, crowning two different champions at the end of the season. The best 2 teams were not guaranteed to play one another either, resulting in hypotheticals about who would win a game between the #1 and #2 teams. As other polls started to catch on (CNN Poll, etc), it was clear that the best teams should settle the argument on the field.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="h4-title">1998 - 2013: The BCS</h3>
  <p id="para"><br>
    The BCS aimed to resolve the Poll Era problems by selecting the best two teams at the end of the season to play for the title. Using a computerized score, the BCS aimed to considered several factors in ranking their teams. Specifically, the score was comprised of 3 factors, all weighted evenly: The Coaches Poll, The Harris Poll, and an average of 6 computer rankings, removing the highest and lowest ranks to account for outliers. The Harris Poll was conducted by market research firm that specialized in internet research and replaced the AP Poll after the AP decided they did not want to be included in the BCS Formula. The Harris Poll closed after the 2013 season. The 6 computer rankings referred to were:<br><br>

    <b>- Sagarin:</b> Teams are ranked using the ELO rating system commonly used in chess. Wins and losses are the main criteria, where a winning team played at a higher score than their opponent. Each team is intiially rated by their expected number of wins, and if a team wins more than their expected value, their rating is bumped up. The model also factors in location of the game to account for difficulty.

    <br><br>
    <b>- Wolfe:</b> Each team is assigned a rating using a Maximum Liklihood Estimator (MLE), and the probability of team A beating team B is simply described as (ARating)/(ARating + BRating). This is described as a Bradley Terry Model.

    <br><br>
    <b>- Massey</b>: Per his website: Each game "connects" two teams via an equation. As more games are played, eventually each team is connected to every other team through some chain of games. When this happens, the system of equations is coupled and a computer is necessary to solve them simultaneously. The ratings are totally interdependent, so that a team's rating is affected by games in which it didn't even play. The solution therefore effectively depends on an infinite chain of opponents, opponents' opponents, opponents' opponents' opponents, etc. The final ratings represent a state of equilibrium in which each team's rating is exactly balanced by its good and bad performances.</b>

    <br><br>
    <b>- Colley:</b> Strength of Schedule and Wins matter most, while score differential or opponents' win percentage don't. A simple statistical model without any correction.</b>

    <br><br>
    <b>- Anderson and Hester:</b> Again, strength of schedule matters. Teams are rewarded for scheduling quality opponents and winning, and score differential does not matter. Teams are further impacted by their opponents' opponents and the overall conference's performance throughout the season.

    <br><br>
    <b>- Billingsley:</b> The only poll to begin the model on the preseason poll, teams are rewarded based on the snapshot of the teams at the time the game was played. For instance, if Washington plays #5 Oregon, and Washington wins while Oregon tanks for the remainder of the season, Washington is still credited with a win against the #5 team. Losses are penalized heavily, and thus being undefeated in this model pays many rewards.</b>

    The BCS Era was the NCAAs first formal acknowledgement of computer rankings, and a step towards reducing any human biases that influenced the polls. The biggest qualm with the BCS was the restriction to 2 teams playing for the championship. With many deserving teams left on the outside (close scores between #2 and #3 for instance), it was time to expand the field.
  </p>

  <h3 id="h4-title">2014 - Present: The College Football Playoff</h3>
  <p id="para"><br>
    The NCAA fixed the BCS problem by establishing the CFP Committee  in 2014, which is comprised of 13 rotating members from the CFB community. This committee selects the best 4 teams to play in the championship playoff. Although the field was expanded from 2 to 4 teams, the decision making of the committee has been questioned severely in the 4 years of its existence, and 2018 is looking to provide another challenging selection. In summary of the committee's questionable decisions:<br><br>

    <b>- 2014:</b> Ohio State over TCU and Baylor. OSU won the Big 10 title, while TCU and Baylor were left out due to a perceived "weaker" schedule. <br><br>

    <b>- 2016:</b> Ohio State over Penn State. PSU beat OSU in a close contest 27-24, and Penn State won the Big 10 title. However, OSU was selected because of a perceived "stronger" schedule. <br><br>

    <b>- 2017:</b> Alabama over Ohio State. Alabama was the second SEC team selected in the playoff (with #1 Georgia). With only 1 loss but no division or conference title, Alabama was selected over Big 10 champion OSU because of a percieved weaker quality of loss. <br><br>

    In 3 of the 4 years the committee has existed, severe contraversy has surrounded the decision made. Inherently built into the structure of this playoff is the exclusion of at least one Power 5 champion. If conference championships will not be considered in selecting the best teams for the national championship, the current selection process is flawed and riddled with the potential for influence by committee members. In an Era where every major sport is embracing data and analytics, College Football should embrace a ranking model based on merit and aim to do away with the biases a board of 13 humans may carry, especially without any transparency of decision making.  The BCS poll worked, and simply required an extension to 4 teams to solve the immediate problems with the BCS.<br><br> 

  However, if the system is to be fixed, there are two main questions to answer: How should opinions and data be balanced? And should we necessarily exclude at least 1 Power 5 conference every year?</p>

  <h3 id="h3-title">A New Playoff</h3>
  <p id="para"><br>
    In our ideal system, we would allow for varying factors to influence rankings. This ensures that the picture taken of the college football world is encompassing of different thoughts of mind. To accommodate this, The BCS formula will be altered twofold. First, the AP Poll and Coaches Poll will account for 1/6 of the score, or 1/3 total. This ensures that human perception influences the rankings, but is not the driving force. Second, an average of 7 Polls will account for 2/3 of the score, with the highest and lowest score for each team discarded. This will ensure that no singular model will hold more weight than another, and as discussed above, will allow for factors such as snapshot wins (beating a then #2 team, etc) to be included. With the advent of newer, advanced computerized model, the 7th poll added to the equation is the ESPN FPI, which is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of a team's performance going forward for the rest of the season, based on 10,000 simulations of the remainder of the season.<br><br>

    To handle questions regarding whether a Power 5 conference champion should be excluded, or whether several teams from a given conference should be selected over another, the playoff must be expanded to 8 teams, where the conference champion from each of the Power 5 conferences shall be given an automatic berth. The remaining 3 teams selected will be the top 3 teams in the rankings who are not already in. This ensures that if a Group of 5 team or a second team from a Power 5 conference gets the chance to compete if they are deserving. The 8 teams will then be seeded by their rankings. Based on this formula, the rankings for this week would be:
